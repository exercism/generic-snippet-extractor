# Basic Mode

The basic mode of the Snippet Extractor is extremely naive but works well to get you started.

A language config file contains a list of the beginnings of lines that can be ignored.
The extractor skips over all lines of code that start with a line in the config file.
Once the extract finds the first non-matching, it returns the next 10 lines, regardless of if they match the config file or not.

Things like HEREDOC and block comments where there is not some marker on each line are not supported.
Use the [Extended Mode](./extended.md) for those.
